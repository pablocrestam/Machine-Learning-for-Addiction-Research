# PubMed search about machine learning in the addiction research field

A PubMed search was carried out on the 22nd of May 2020 using the following criteria terms:
(((((substance abuse) OR substance addiction) OR addiction)) AND (((machine learning) OR data mining) OR artificial intelligence)) AND ("english"[Language])
 
A total of 609 articles were found.

These articles were analyzed according to their title and abstract, and 406 articles were left out because they were not related to the topic of interest. Thus, 203 articles were selected.
Then, abstracts were analyzed to classify their content adding tags described in table 1. During this analysis, 11 articles were dropped, obtaining the final number of 192 (164 original articles and 28 review articles).

Another search was carried out to find the total number of publications in the addiction field. Considering the fact that the number of articles per year is increasing in almost every research field, we want to calculate the ratio between machine learning articles in addiction with regard to the total number of articles in the addiction research field. Therefore, we used the same criteria terms in PubMed extracting those terms linked with machine learning:
 ((((((substance abuse) OR substance addiction) OR addiction)) AND ("english"[Language])) AND (("1800/01/01"[Date - Create] : "2020/05/22"[Date - Create]))
