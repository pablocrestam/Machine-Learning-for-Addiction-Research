In this repository, you can find two CSV files with the PubMed search. The file named MachineLearning_addiction_articles included all the articles filtered about machine learning in the addiction field. This file has article data, such as year of publication, title, and authors; and also has several columns with a tag related to the content of each article, such as the application context, the study aim, and the substance analyzed.
The second file, Relation_Addiction_ML-Total, has the article count per year about addiction research and machine learning in the addiction research field. These counts were used to calculate the ratio between them (machine learning articles/total articles in addiction) per year.
We include a file with the details about PubMed search and its analysis.
This repository also has the script used for the analysis in R software.
